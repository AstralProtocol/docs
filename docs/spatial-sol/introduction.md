# Introduction

Enabling Onchain Geospatial Computation in the EVM

## Overview

This proposal outlines a research and development project aimed at creating a comprehensive collection of spatial data structures and geospatial algorithms—collectively known as **Spatial.sol** — optimized for deployment on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Our goal is to enable a new vertical of location-based decentralized applications (dapps) by providing developers with open-source, gas-efficient, and secure geospatial computational tools that operate directly onchain.

## Background

Astral has been at the forefront of building open-source decentralized geospatial tools and infrastructure for Web3. Our ongoing work includes:

- **Location Protocol:** A user-controlled, composable, and verifiable framework for proving location.
- **Spatial Registries:** Described [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/verifiable-spatial-data-registries/6688).
- **Spatial.sol (prototype)**

While these initiatives have validated the potential of onchain geospatial technologies, a critical missing piece remains: the ability to efficiently perform geospatial computations on the EVM. This module will fill that gap by developing spatial data structures and algorithms that empower developers to build location-based dapps with rich spatial functionalities.

# Overview

This section will contain **raw signals**, categorized under the [strategies](../strategies/index.md).
Signals are the **observables** that plugins can transform into verifiable stamps.

For now, we treat this as a **research agenda**: a living list of signals we intend to document.

| Signal | Strategy | Context |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GNSS pseudoranges | Network Measurements | Core satellite navigation raw values |
| Wi-Fi SSID/BSSID | Machine Identifiers | Device-visible broadcast IDs |
| Bluetooth MACs | Machine Identifiers | Short-range device identifiers |
| Cell IDs | Machine Identifiers | Tower IDs used by carriers |
| IP / ASN | Machine Identifiers | Reported by network layer |
| RTT latency | Network Measurements | Round-trip time between nodes |
| RSSI trilateration | Network Measurements | Signal strength analysis for range |
| Inertial IMU | Sensor Data | Accelerometer/gyroscope traces |
| Microphone acoustics | Sensor Data | Ambient sound signatures |
| Camera EXIF | Sensor Data | Embedded photo metadata |
| Delegated datasets | Delegated | Uber ride, bank statement, utility bill |
| Legal documents | Legal | Bills of lading, customs docs, affidavits |

Each entry will eventually have its own page. For now, this list signals where research is headed.

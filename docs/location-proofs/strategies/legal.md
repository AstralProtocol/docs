# Legal

**Definition:**  
Location evidence embedded in formal legal instruments where the claimant is directly accountable under law.  
Unlike [Delegated](./delegated.md) records (which are service or registry data), Legal proofs are created when a person or entity **signs a statement of location** that would be legally punishable if false.

**Examples:**  
- A sworn affidavit: “I was present at this place and time.”  
- A court filing that specifies location of an event or asset.  
- A notarized declaration of presence.  
- Customs or shipping declarations signed under penalty of law.  

**Derivation method:**  
The claimant (or their representative) signs a legally binding document that includes a location claim. Verification relies on the legal system’s enforcement of perjury and fraud statutes.

**Risks:**  
- Depends heavily on jurisdiction and enforcement.  
- Can be slow and bureaucratic to obtain.  
- False claims are still possible if enforcement is weak or corruption is present.

# Network Measurements

**Definition:**
Location derived from measured values produced by network interactions.

**Examples:**
- GNSS pseudoranges (satellite timing)
- RTT / latency between nodes
- WitnessChain co-location checks
- Proximum timing proofs
- RSSI trilateration (signal strength)

**Derivation method:**
Measured values â†’ compute position using physics or geometry.

**Risks:**
Measurements can be manipulated (signal jamming, GNSS spoofing, latency injection).

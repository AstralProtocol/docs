# Authority

**Definition:**  
Location evidence provided by an individual or organization acting in a *privileged or trusted role*.  
Unlike [Social](./social.md) attestations, where peers vouch for each other, Authority attestations come from gatekeepers or officials recognized to have asymmetric credibility.

**Examples:**  
- A border control officer stamping a passport at entry/exit.  
- An event host scanning and recording ticket check-ins.  
- A surveyor or notary signing a certificate of presence.  
- A customs officer recording inspection of goods.  

**Derivation method:**  
A person in an official role issues an attestation tied to place (and often time). The verifier trusts the claim because of the authority vested in the role, not the number of peers.

**Risks:**  
- Centralized trust in institutions or roles.  
- Potential for abuse, coercion, or corruption.  
- Often requires disclosure of identity, which can raise privacy concerns.

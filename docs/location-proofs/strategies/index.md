# Overview

**Strategies** are broad categories of how location signals can be derived.
They provide the conceptual map under which specific [signals](../signals/index.md) are organized.

The seven strategies we track:

- [Machine Identifiers](./machine-identifiers.md)
- [Network Measurements](./network-measurements.md)
- [Sensor Data](./sensor-data.md)
- [Delegated](./delegated.md)
- [Social](./social.md)
- [Authority](./authority.md)
- [Legal](./legal.md)

Each strategy page gives a concise definition and typical examples.

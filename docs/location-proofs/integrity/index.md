# Overview

Integrity assurances are **mechanisms that increase trust** in a signal or plugin.
They are not signals themselves but modifiers of credibility.

Examples under study:
- **Android Play Integrity API** — attests to app and device state.
- **Apple App Attest** — verifies iOS app legitimacy.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** — enclaves like TrustZone, SGX, Secure Enclave.
- **Hardware-backed keys** — signing with embedded secure elements.
- **Secure boot chains** — device starts in a verified state.
- **C2PA content credentials** — media provenance.
- **Timestamp notaries** — external time anchors.

Future pages will expand these into detailed references.

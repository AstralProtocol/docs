Quick definitions with links:

- **Location stamp** — a discrete, verifiable signal of where/when something happened.
- **Location proof** — a combination of stamps verified together. See [Recipes](./recipes/index.md).
- **Strategy** — top-level category of how location is derived. See [Strategies](./strategies/index.md).
- **Signal** — raw observable used as evidence. See [Signals](./signals/index.md).
- **Plugin** — implementation that transforms signals into signed stamps. See [Plugins](./plugins/index.md).
- **Recipe** — composition of plugins into multifactor proofs. See [Recipes](./recipes/index.md).
- **Integrity assurance** — mechanism that increases confidence in a signal or plugin. See [Integrity](./integrity/index.md).
- **Device / OS** — platforms where signals can be captured and integrity applied. See [Device / OS](./device-os/index.md).

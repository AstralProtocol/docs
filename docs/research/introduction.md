## Decentralized Geospatial Collaborative

Astral co-founded the Decentralized Geospatial Collaborative, bringing together partners and researchers from across the ecosystem to advance open geospatial technologies.

Most of the recent work on decentralized geospatial data storage and access technologies have been done by our friends over at the EASIER Data Initiative, based at the University of Maryland.

You can find extensive information on their work [here](https://easierdata.org/); if you'd like to be connected, reach out on Telegram.
